# String Manipulator

Individual Assignment
Understand the Application

Every programming assignment is as much a test of English language comprehension as it is a test of programming or mathematical skills.  This week, we will be using pieces of the String class and are given clearly if you read carefully.  However, if there is any question about what is being asked, you are urged to ask for clarification in the public forum.
We will be using several of the built-in methods from the String class this week as well as static finals and the Decimal Format class.  Be sure you are comfortable with the material before starting this program.

# The Program Spec

Part 1:
Be sure to use the naming conventions mentioned in the book, which is camelCase for regular variables, while static final variables are in the form of ALL_CAPS. (If you are a seasoned programmer and prefer a different style, contact me privately about using it)
We are going to start by asking the user to enter their first name and last name and store them in separate String variables.  Ask them to capitalize the first letter of each name. Now concatenate them into one variable, with a space in between, called: fullName. 
Print out their full name and the length of it. Next, print the full name in all upper case and then in all lower case.

# Part 2:
Create 2 static final variables, one for the minimum number of hours you should spend on this class each week, and the other for the max. (These are 12-20 hours) Use MIN_HOURS and MAX_HOURS.
Print that range and then ask the user to enter how many hours they have spent this week to 3 decimal places.
No validation is needed.  Just state to the user what you want and assume that they enter it correctly on this assignment.
Use the Decimal Format class to print the rounded value of the user's hours to 1 decimal place.
Both parts(1 and 2) go inside of one program.

# Comments

Comments are required for each program.  I expect that you put a header above the top of the program stating your name and what program it is.  Each section of important code as well as calculation sections should have comments .  As we get into methods and classes, each of those should have comments above them talking about what they do and how they function as well.  The purpose is to allow someone else to quickly and easily read what your program will do, in English, and not have to interpret all of your code in order to know where things are.  You can use single line comments with // or multi-line comments using /* and end with */
 

# Test Run Requirements:

I want at least two runs as part of the output that you will put at the bottom of the code.

**Submit one .txt file that has the main class and output.
